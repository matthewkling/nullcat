Title: Null models for categorical and continuous community matrices
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Matthew Kling
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: Provides novel null model algorithms for categorical and quantitative community ecology data. Extends classic binary null models (e.g., curveball, swap) to work with categorical data, and introduces a stratified randomization framework for continuous data that addresses limitations in existing quantitative null model methods.
