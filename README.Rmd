# nullcat

Null models for categorical and quantized continuous data in community ecology. 

This package extends classic **binary** null models to work with **categorical** data. Categorical generalizations currently include `curveball -> curvecat` and `swap -> swapcat`.

It also provides a routine for using these algorithms with **continuous** data. This `quantize()` routine works by converting continuous values to discrete strata, randomizing them using categorical algorithms, and mapping the randomized categories back to the original quantities.
