\usage{
nullcat(
  x,
  method = nullcat_methods(),
  n_iter = 1000L,
  output = c("category", "index"),
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of categorical data, encoded as integers.
Values should represent category or stratum membership for each cell.}

\item{method}{Character specifying the randomization algorithm to use.
Options include the following; see details and linked functions
for more info.
\itemize{
  \item \code{"curvecat"}: categorical analog to `curveball`;
       see \link{curvecat} for details.
  \item \code{"swapcat"}: categorical analog to `swap`;
       see \link{swapcat} for details.
  \item \code{"tswapcat"}: categorical analog to `tswap`;
       see \link{tswapcat} for details.
  \item \code{"r0cat"}: categorical analog to `r0`;
       see \link{r0cat} for details.
  \item \code{"c0cat"}: categorical analog to `c0`;
       see \link{c0cat} for details.
}}

\item{n_iter}{Number of iterations. Default is 1000. Larger values yield
more thorough mixing. Ignored for non-sequential methods. Minimum
burn-in times can be estimated with \link{suggest_n_iter}.}

\item{output}{Character indicating type of result to return:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"category"} (default) returns randomized matrix
  \item \code{"index"} returns an index matrix describing where original
       entries moved.
}}

\item{seed}{Integer used to seed random number generator, for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimensions as \code{x}, either randomized
  categorical values (when \code{output = "category"}) or an integer index
  matrix describing the permutation of entries (when \code{output = "index"}).
}
\description{
Categorical generalizations of binary community null model algorithms.
}
\details{
`curvecat`, `swapcat`, and `tswapcat` are sequential algorithms that hold
category multisets fixed in every row and column. These three algorithms
typically reach the same stationary distribution. They differ primarily in
efficiency, with `curvecat` being the most efficient (i.e. fewest steps to
become fully mixed); `swapcat` and `tswapcat` are thus useful mainly for
methodological comparison.

The `r0cat` algorithm holds category multisets fixed in rows but not columns,
while `c0cat` does the opposite.

Note that categorical null models are for cell-level categorical data. Site-level
attributes (e.g., land cover) or species-level attributes (e.g., functional
traits) should be analyzed using different approaches.
