\title{Row-constrained categorical randomization (r0cat)}
\usage{
r0cat(x, n_iter = 1L, output = c("category", "index"), seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of categorical data, encoded as integers.
Values should represent category or stratum membership for each cell.}

\item{n_iter}{Number of iterations. Default is 1000. Larger values yield
more thorough mixing. Ignored for non-sequential methods. Minimum
burn-in times can be estimated with \link{suggest_n_iter}.}

\item{output}{Character indicating type of result to return:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"category"} (default) returns randomized matrix
  \item \code{"index"} returns an index matrix describing where original
       entries moved.
}}

\item{seed}{Integer used to seed random number generator, for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimensions as \code{x}, either randomized
  categorical values (when \code{output = "category"}) or an integer index
  matrix describing the permutation of entries (when \code{output = "index"}).
}
\description{
`r0cat()` preserves the multiset of categories within each row but
randomizes their positions across columns, leaving column margins free.
This is the categorical analog to vegan's `r0` algorithm. It is a
non-sequential method.
