\title{Nullcat-based commsim (sequential / Markov chain)}
\usage{
nullcat_commsim_seq(
  method = nullcat_methods(),
  output = c("category", "index")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Character specifying which nullcat randomization algorithm
to use. See [nullcat()] and [nullcat_methods()] for details.}

\item{output}{Character, passed to `nullcat(output = ...)`.
Typically `"category"` (default) or `"index"`.}
}
\value{
An object of class `"commsim"` suitable for use with
  `vegan::nullmodel()` and `vegan::oecosimu()`.
}
\description{
Construct a `vegan::commsim()` object that uses [nullcat()] as a
*sequential* null model: successive simulated matrices form a
Markov chain. Internally, each simulation "step" advances the chain
by `thin` trades of the chosen `method` (e.g. `"curvecat"`), where
`thin` is supplied via `vegan::simulate.nullmodel()`` arguments.
This is analogous to how sequential swap / curveball null models
are used in **vegan**, but extended to categorical data via
[nullcat()].
}
\section{Details}{


This model is **sequential**: simulated matrices form a Markov chain. The current matrix is
updated in-place by repeated calls to the randomization model, and successive
matrices are obtained by advancing the chain.

In `vegan::simulate.nullmodel()`, the control arguments behave as:
\itemize{
  \item `nsim`: number of matrices to *store* from the chain.
  \item `thin`: number of trades per step. Each "step" of the chain
  applies `thin` trades of the chosen `method` to the current state
  before possibly storing it.
  \item `burnin`: number of initial steps to perform (each with `thin`
  trades) before storing any matrices, i.e. the Markov chain
  burn-in.
}

There is no `n_iter` argument here: mixing is controlled entirely by
`thin` (trades per step) and `burnin` (number of initial steps
discarded), in the same spirit as sequential swap / curveball models
in **vegan**.

\dontrun{
  library(vegan)

  x  <- matrix(sample(1:5, 50, replace = TRUE), 10, 5)
  cs <- nullcat_commsim_seq(method = "curvecat")

  nm <- nullmodel(x, cs)

  # control the chain with 'thin' and 'burnin'
  sims <- simulate(nm, nsim = 999, thin = 100, burnin = 1000)
