\title{Categorical Curveball Randomization}
\usage{
curvecat(x, n_iter = 1000L)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of categorical data, encoded as integers or factors.
Values should represent category or stratum membership for each cell.}

\item{n_iter}{Integer specifying the number of randomization iterations
(row-pair trades) to perform. Larger values yield more thorough mixing.
The default is \code{1000}.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimensions and type as \code{x}, with its
categorical entries randomized while preserving the marginal category
multisets of each row and column.
}
\description{
Performs a single categorical \emph{curveball} randomization of a matrix,
preserving the marginal category multisets of each row and column.
This is the categorical generalization of the binary curveball algorithm
(Strona et al. 2014), which swaps entries between randomly chosen row pairs
while maintaining their category counts.
}
\details{
The \code{curvecat()} algorithm treats each cell of \code{x} as belonging
to a categorical stratum (integer or factor level). At each iteration, two
rows are selected at random and their differing entries are exchanged in
random order, ensuring that each row retains its original set of categories.
When repeated many times, this procedure generates randomized matrices that
preserve row and column category frequencies while randomizing their joint
associations.


This function provides a convenient R wrapper around the underlying
C++ implementation \code{curvecat_cpp()}, which performs the randomization
efficiently in compiled code.

\examples{
set.seed(1)
m <- matrix(sample(1:4, 20 * 30, replace = TRUE), nrow = 20)
m_rand <- curvecat(m, n_iter = 1000)
mean(m_rand == m)  # fraction of unchanged cells
